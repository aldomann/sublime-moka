### How to Install

#### Via Package Control

The easiest way to install is using [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net), where Moka is listed as `Theme - Moka`.

1. Open Command Palette using menu item `Tools -> Command Palette...` (⇧+⌘+P on Mac)
2. Choose `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Find `Theme - Moka` and hit Enter

#### Manual

You can also install the theme manually:

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `Theme - Moka`
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...`

***

### How to Activate

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (⌘+, on Mac).

You can choose whichever flavor you like, but don't forget to change *both* color scheme and UI theme so they match.

***Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.***
